# Title
Easy solution | Explained by a human (that's not that smart)

# Intuition

First you begin by thinking about the problem overall: 'What must I do in order to solve this problem?'. We know that we're going to have to loop over every character, and then we know we have to keep track of the amount each character appears in the input string 's'. What first came to my mind was a frequency table in the form of a dictionary.

# Approach

To start, we make our vowels list, and then we get two frequency tables. Initial intuition made me only make one, but separating it into two is much easier to deal with, at atleast for me. After we tally everything up, we can simply just add the max() from both dictionaries and return that for our answer!

# Notes

The reason we do .get() on our dictionaries is because we need to find if it exists or not in it. You could initialize all of it beforehand and just += 1. There is no right or wrong; this was just my solution, and it made the most sense to me :)

Keep in mind that max() freaks out if you give it something that's empty; therefore, you must include 'default' = 0; otherwise, something like an all-vowel or all-consonant input will cause an error.

# Code

```python3 []
class Solution:
    def maxFreqSum(self, s: str) -> int:
        vowels = ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']
        # Default them incase there isn't anything that gets put in them
        vowel_freq = {}
        cons_freq = {}

        for char in s:
            if char in vowels:
                vowel_freq[char] = vowel_freq.get(char, 0) + 1
            else:
                cons_freq[char] = cons_freq.get(char, 0) + 1
        
        return max(vowel_freq.values(), default=0) + max(cons_freq.values(), default=0)
```
